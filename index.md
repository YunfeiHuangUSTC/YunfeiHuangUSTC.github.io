### Research Experience
#### Silicon-based Spin Qubits (Research Internship)(Aug. 2019 - Present)
Adivisor: Prof. Haiou Li    [Group Homepage http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/qt](http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/qt/)

+ Performed spin-resolved electron transport experiments in single and double Si quantum dots at liquid helium temperature.
+ To construct a radio-frequency reflectometry coupled with the gate electrodes allowing scalable and sensitive spin readout and manipulation.

#### Terahertz Spectroscopy of Antibiotics (College Physics Experiment IV)(Oct. 2020 - Jan.2021)
Advisor: Dr. Hengyi Li

+	Constructed a terahertz time-domain spectrometer with self-designed beam path and sample holder.
+	Measured the terahertz absorption spectroscopy of four different tetracyclines.
+	Identified the signatures of the principal components in the four tetracyclines from the measured terahertz absorption data.
